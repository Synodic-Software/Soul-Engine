**Issues**

- We use Zenhub which enhances Github issues. While not necessary, it helps with our internal management. You can find it [here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd?hl=en-US)

- Issues and pull requests should be tagged as appropriate and included in a milestone.  

- Boards should be used to track the progress of these issues and pull requests.  

- Story points and Epics should be used to clearly separate the major issues from the minor ones.

- If your issue is part of a larger project, add it to the project board.

- An issue should always be created before any coding begins.
