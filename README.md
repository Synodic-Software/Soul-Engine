# What is Soul Engine?
Soul Engine is a physically based renderer and engine for real-time applications on any 
system with CUDA (primary) or OpenCL (secondary) support. 

#Features
These include planned features for aid in the vision of the final application.
  -Spectral bidirectional path tracer
  -GPU physics pipeline which includes an FEM solver for all objects
  -A ray engine which handles ray requests and processes them in bulk.
  -Sound path tracing with a multi-listener setup.
  -Shader system allowing for immediate artist controlled changes.
  -Fiber implementation for task based CPU processing.
  
# Current Status
At the moment, the project is unrunnable due to massive shifts in pipeline reording and code management.
For your propiertery purposes, an alternate license will be also made available once the project is in a decent enough shape.
