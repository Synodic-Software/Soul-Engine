Soul Engine is a real-time visualization engine built on the back of CUDA and Vulkan. With a focus on lightweight parallelism that can be leveraged for expensive techniques, Soul Engine provides a platform for path tracing, finite element physics, and general simulation.

## **Warning**
Soul Engine is undergoing a large user-facing refactor and is not stable. Incomplete public features will be removed in preparation for the first use of Semantic Versioning.

In the meantime expect to see the following features make their way in as we approach stability:

* Subsystem modularity
* Testing framework
* Continuous integration
* Simplified manual installation
* Automated C++/Python dependency installation
* Dynamic and static plugins
* Directory tree cleanup

Once Soul Engine hits 1.0, codebase stability will become a priority. Thank you for your patience.
