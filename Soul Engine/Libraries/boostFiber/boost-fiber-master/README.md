boost.fiber
===========

boost.fiber provides a framework for micro-/userland-threads (fibers) scheduled cooperativly.
The API contains classes and functions to manage and synchronize fibers similiar to boost.thread.

A fiber is able to store the current execution state, including all registers and CPU flags, the 
instruction pointer, and the stack pointer and later restore this state. The idea is to have multiple 
execution paths running on a single thread using a sort of cooperative scheduling (threads are 
preemptively scheduled) - the running fiber decides explicitly when its yields to allow another fiber to
run (context switching).

A context switch between threads costs usally thousends of CPU cycles on x86 compared to a fiber switch 
with less than 100 cycles. A fiber can only run on a single thread at any point in time.

Building: Detailed instructions can be found at https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/TryModBoost.

boost.fiber is C++14-only!
