This folder contains source code and pre-built debuggable libaries for
the Vulkan loader and validation laysers. It is intended for use with
the demos in the Demos folder in the SDK for stepping through the
loader/layers source code when debugging one one of the demo programs,
as an aid in understanding how the loader/layers work.

The source code in this folder cannot be used to build the Vulkan loader
and/or layers.  If you wish to build the Vulkan loader and/or layers,
use the source available from
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-LoaderAndValidationLayers.
